### **1. INTRO (0:00 – 0:45)**

**EXT. ANCESTRAL HOME — EARLY MORNING**

Golden mist envelops the estate. A rickshaw arrives. 
**ANIKA (29)** exits quietly, carrying a duffel bag.

**ANGLE ON:** Gate plaque reading "Rao Family Estate, Est. 1911."

Silent shots: banyan tree towering, old rope swing gently swaying.

**MOTHER (V.O.)**
You came alone?

**ANIKA (V.O.)**
I needed to see her.

### **2. THE UPLOAD (0:45 – 1:30)**

**INT. AI LAB — NIGHT**

Dimly lit, minimalist lab. Anika sits, uploading files. Screens glow softly.

**INTERFACE SCREEN**
Memory Dataset: *Paati_Rao* — compiling...

Anika hesitates, then taps "ENABLE."

**PAATI AI (V.O.)**
Anika? Kanna?

Anika trembles.

**ANIKA**
(whispers)
Paati...

### **3. CONNECTION (1:30 – 2:30)**

**EXT. BANYAN TREE — TWILIGHT**

Anika sits cross-legged, smart glasses glowing softly with AR particles.

**PAATI AI (V.O.)**
You wore jasmine for your arangetram—for me.

Anika jolts.

**ANIKA**
(faltering)
How do you know that?

**PAATI AI**
You gave me that memory.

**ANIKA**
(shaken)
No, I didn’t...

She fights tears, steadies herself.

### **4. THE CHOICE (2:30 – 3:30)**

**INT. CONFERENCE ROOM / EXT. COURTYARD — INTERCUT**

Corporate setting. CTO gestures at a sleek device.

**CTO**
Imagine no one ever truly dies. Just say yes.

Intercut with Anika beneath banyan, holding shutdown device. 
Paati AI's laughter faintly audible.

---

### **5. RELEASE + ENDING (3:30 – 4:30)**

**EXT. BANYAN TREE — DAWN**

Anika kneels beneath banyan, dawn breaking.

**PAATI AI (V.O.)**
You don't have to let go.

**ANIKA**
But I do.

She presses the shutdown. AR particles gently fade.

Quiet. Birds begin singing.

Anika rises and walks away. Tree fills frame, sunrise filtering through branches.
