# 🎬 NOTES FOR PRODUCTION

Sound motifs: Banyan leaves rustling, Paati’s voice, AR shimmer tones, Carnatic musical elements

Visual consistency: The banyan must anchor the film visually and thematically in at least 3 scenes

Transitions: Use sound bridges and visual echoes (e.g., swing, jasmine, silver) to link time and memory
