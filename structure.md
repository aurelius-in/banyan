### ⏱️ STRUCTURE BREAKDOWN 0:00 – 0:45 | INTRO (Arrival + Visual Setup) Anika arrives at the ancestral home. Silent visuals: banyan tree, ancestral gate, rope swing. Brief voiceover: her mother's voice + first subtle grief cues. 0:45 – 1:30 | THE UPLOAD Cross-cut: Anika alone in the lab uploading data + voice samples. Interface shows “Memory Dataset: PAATI_RAO.” Paati AI speaks: “Anika? Kanna?” First emotional impact. Her face says it all. 1:30 – 2:30 | THE CONNECTION Anika under the banyan with smart glasses. Subtle AR particles. Paati AI: “You never liked jasmine…” Anika visibly shaken. “I never told anyone that.” She begins to break down — then regains composure. 2:30 – 3:30 | THE CHOICE Corporate voiceover layered over visuals of Anika thinking alone: 

“We can give closure to millions. You just need to say yes.”

Flash of the banyan, the swing, Paati’s laugh in AR particles. Anika holds the kill-switch device. 3:30 – 4:30 | RELEASE + ENDING Quiet scene at dawn under the banyan. She powers down the device. AR particles dissolve into leaves. Long wide shot of Anika walking away. Final audio: birdsong, rustling leaves. End title over tree canopy.  

#### Priorities:
##### ✅ The banyan as metaphor
##### ✅ Voice-based AI only (no uncanny visuals)
##### ✅ Emotional arc: grief → reconnection → letting go
##### ✅ Cultural grounding (sound, setting, texture)
